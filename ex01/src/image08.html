                <h4>Jogging</h4>
                <p>Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to
                    increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than
                    walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it
                    is a form of aerobic endurance training.

                    Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One
                    definition describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes
                    defined as requiring a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the
                    contact.</p>
